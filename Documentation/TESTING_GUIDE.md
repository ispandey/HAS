```

### If Dashboard Data Doesn't Load:
```bash
# Check network tab in browser DevTools
# Verify API calls to http://localhost:5001/api/*
# Check for CORS errors
# Verify JWT token in localStorage
```

### If Images Don't Display:
- Unsplash URLs should work without authentication
- Check browser console for image loading errors
- Verify `hostel.images` array has valid URLs

# Test API endpoints directly:
curl http://localhost:5001/api/hostels
```

## üìù Notes

- **Unused Import Warnings:** ESLint shows warnings for unused imports (Delete, Tooltip, etc.). These don't affect functionality.
- **useEffect Dependencies:** Warning about missing dependencies in useEffect. This is intentional to prevent infinite loops.
- **Mock Data:** Some stats (like occupancy rate) are hardcoded for demo purposes.
- **Navigation Routes:** Add/Edit hostel forms need to be created separately for full owner functionality.

---

1. **Create Hostel Forms:**
