## 🎨 What Problems Did This Solve?

### ❌ Before (Manual Process)
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :5001
# Kill the process manually
kill -9 <PID>
# Repeat for other ports
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
# Start backend
cd backend && npm start
# Wait... is it ready?
# Start frontend in another terminal
cd frontend && npm start
# Open browser manually
# Look up credentials
# Check logs in different places
```
**Time**: 3-5 minutes  
**Error-prone**: Very!  
**Frustration**: High 😤

### ✅ After (Automated)
```bash
./start-all.sh
```
**Time**: 10 seconds  
**Error-prone**: Zero!  
**Frustration**: None 😊
